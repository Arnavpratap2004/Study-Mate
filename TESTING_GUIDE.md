## Prerequisites

### Required Software
- ‚úÖ Node.js (v18 or higher)
- ‚úÖ npm (comes with Node.js)
- ‚úÖ AWS Account with configured services
- ‚úÖ Git (optional, for version control)

### AWS Services Setup
Before testing, ensure these AWS services are configured:
- ‚úÖ S3 Bucket: `study-mate-pdfs`
- ‚úÖ DynamoDB Table: `study-mate-files`
- ‚úÖ IAM User with proper permissions (see `AWS_SETUP.md`)

---

## üîß Backend Testing

### Step 1: Navigate to Backend Directory
```bash
cd c:\Users\Arnav\Desktop\study-mate\backend
```

### Step 2: Verify Dependencies
Check if `node_modules` exists. If not, install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables
Open `.env` file and ensure all variables are set:
```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY

# AWS Services
S3_BUCKET_NAME=study-mate-pdfs
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=study-mate-files
```

### Step 4: Test AWS Connection
Run the AWS connection test script:
```bash
node test-aws.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ S3 Connection successful
Buckets: [ 'study-mate-pdfs', ... ]
‚úÖ DynamoDB Connection successful
Tables: [ 'study-mate-files', ... ]
```

**If you see errors:**
- ‚ùå Check your AWS credentials in `.env`
- ‚ùå Verify IAM permissions
- ‚ùå Ensure S3 bucket and DynamoDB table exist

### Step 5: Start Backend Server
```bash
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ AWS Configuration loaded successfully:
   - Region: ap-south-1

## üîÑ End-to-End Testing

Now let's test the complete workflow from upload to search!

### Test Scenario 1: Upload a PDF

#### Step 1: Prepare a Test PDF

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click **"Upload"** tab
3. Click **"Choose PDF file..."**
4. Select your PDF file
5. Verify file info appears (name and size)
6. Click **"Upload & Process"** button

#### Step 3: Monitor Progress
**In the browser:**
- Button should show "Processing..." with a spinner
- This may take 10-60 seconds (Textract processing time)

**In the backend terminal, you should see:**
```
Processing file: AWS Trusted Advisor (1).pdf, Size: 217167 bytes
File uploaded to S3: pdfs/uuid-filename.pdf
Starting Textract document text detection...
Textract job started with JobId: abc123...
Textract job completed successfully
Extracted text length: 5432 characters
Extracted 15 keywords and 10 topics
Metadata stored in DynamoDB for fileId: uuid
```

#### Step 4: Verify Success
After processing completes, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Green success message: "Upload Successful!"
- File details (name, ID, keyword count, topic count)
- Preview of top keywords as tags
- "üìÑ View PDF" link

#### Step 5: Click "View PDF"
- Should open the PDF in a new tab
- PDF should be viewable (presigned S3 URL)

### Test Scenario 2: Search for Files

#### Step 1: Switch to Search Tab
1. Click the **"Search"** tab

#### Step 2: Search by Keyword
1. Enter a keyword from your uploaded PDF (e.g., "aws", "advisor", "trusted")
2. Click **"Search"** button

- Result card with:
  - üìÑ File name
  - File size and upload date
  - Keywords tags
  - Topics tags
  - "üìñ View PDF" button

#### Step 4: Test Multiple Searches
Try different keywords:
- Keywords that exist in the PDF (should return results)

- Partial keywords (should still match)

### Test Scenario 3: Upload Multiple Files

#### Step 1: Upload 2-3 Different PDFs
Repeat the upload process with different PDF files on different topics.

#### Step 2: Search for Common Keywords
Search for keywords that might appear in multiple files.

#### Step 3: Verify Multiple Results

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

#### Issue: "S3_BUCKET_NAME is not configured"
**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file exists in backend folder
2. Verify `S3_BUCKET_NAME=study-mate-pdfs` is set
3. Restart the backend server

#### Issue: "AccessDeniedException" when uploading
**Solution:**
1. Check IAM user permissions
2. Ensure user has `textract:StartDocumentTextDetection` permission
3. See `AWS_SETUP.md` for required permissions

#### Issue: "Textract job timed out"
**Solution:**
1. PDF might be too large or complex
2. Try a smaller PDF (< 5 pages)
3. Check AWS Textract service status

#### Issue: "Port 5000 already in use"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Find process using port 5000
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or change port in .env
PORT=5001
```

### Frontend Issues

#### Issue: "Failed to fetch" or CORS error
**Solution:**
1. Ensure backend is running on port 5000
2. Check `VITE_API_URL` in frontend `.env`
3. Verify CORS is enabled in backend

#### Issue: "Port 5173 already in use"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill the process
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or Vite will automatically use next available port
```

#### Issue: Upload button stays disabled
**Solution:**
1. Ensure you selected a PDF file (not other formats)
2. Check file size is < 10MB
3. Check browser console for errors

### AWS Issues

#### Issue: "Bucket does not exist"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Create the bucket
aws s3 mb s3://study-mate-pdfs --region ap-south-1
```

#### Issue: "Table does not exist"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Create the DynamoDB table
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name study-mate-files \
    --attribute-definitions AttributeName=fileId,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema AttributeName=fileId,KeyType=HASH \
    --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST \
    --region ap-south-1
```
